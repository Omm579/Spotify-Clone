🎵 Just launched my most exciting project yet - a fully functional Spotify Clone! 🚀

After weeks of coding and countless cups of coffee ☕, I'm thrilled to share what I've built:

✨ WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL:
🎧 Real audio playback with working player controls
🇮🇳 42+ authentic Indian songs across 4 categories:
   • Bollywood superhits from A.R. Rahman, Arijit Singh
   • Classical ragas by legends like Pandit Ravi Shankar
   • Regional gems in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Punjabi & more
   • Devotional music for spiritual moments
🎨 Apple-level design aesthetics with smooth animations
🔐 Complete user authentication system
📱 Fully responsive across all devices

🛠️ TECH STACK:
React 18 | TypeScript | Tailwind CSS | Context API | React Router | Vite

🌟 WHY THIS PROJECT MATTERS:
Beyond just cloning Spotify, I wanted to celebrate India's rich musical heritage in a modern digital format. Technology should bridge cultures, not divide them.

🎯 KEY FEATURES:
✅ Working audio player with shuffle, repeat, volume control
✅ Multi-language search (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, etc.)
✅ Cultural categorization of Indian music
✅ Playlist management and browsing
✅ Protected routes and user sessions
✅ Live deployment on Netlify

💡 WHAT I LEARNED:
• Advanced React patterns and state management
• Audio API integration and real-time controls
• Cultural sensitivity in tech design
• Responsive design principles
• Modern deployment workflows

This project represents more than just code - it's about creating inclusive technology that celebrates diversity while delivering exceptional user experiences.

🤝 I'd love to hear your thoughts! What features would you add to make it even better?
