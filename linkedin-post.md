🎵 **Excited to share my latest project: A Full-Featured Spotify Clone with Indian Music Collection!** 🇮🇳

After weeks of development, I've built a comprehensive music streaming application that brings together the best of both worlds - international hits and authentic Indian music.

## 🚀 **What I Built:**

✅ **42+ Indian Songs** - Bollywood, Classical, Regional & Devotional music
✅ **User Authentication** - Secure login/signup system
✅ **Responsive Design** - Perfect on all devices
✅ **Advanced Player** - Shuffle, repeat, volume control, progress tracking
✅ **Multi-language Search** - Find songs in Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, and more

## 🎭 **Indian Music Collection Highlights:**
🎬 **Bollywood Superhits** - 12 classic and modern Hindi film songs
🎼 **Classical Ragas** - 10 traditional Hindustani and Carnatic pieces
🌍 **Regional Gems** - 12 songs across Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Punjabi, Malayalam
🙏 **Devotional Music** - 8 sacred songs and mantras

## 💻 **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **Audio:** HTML5 Audio API with custom controls
- **Deployment:** Netlify with automatic builds

## 🌟 **Key Features:**
- Apple-level design aesthetics with Spotify's signature dark theme
- Cultural sensitivity in organizing Indian music by genre and language

This project represents my passion for both technology and cultural diversity. Music is universal, but every culture has its unique flavor - and I wanted to celebrate that through code.

What do you think? Would love to hear your feedback and thoughts on how technology can better represent cultural diversity! 🎶
